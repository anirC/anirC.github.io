<h2>
I am a PhD student at the University of Cumberlands in the School of Information Sciences. Specifically, in the statistics group advised by Dr. Gareth James and Dr. Xin Tong. I am interested in the intersection of Statistics and Computer Science, Machine Learning, Topological Data Analysis, Network Analysis, Graphical Methods, and Mathematical Statistics. My research is currently supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

Before joining UC, I was at Fairfield University doing my MS in Business Analytics in the department of Statistics and Data Science. I recieved my BS in Electronics & Communication Engg. from the North eastern Hill University in 2004 and during the last decade and a half I have been gainfully employed, workin with latest technologies in various industries.

My name is Anirban Chakraborty and I have been working with Data since 2006 as a Data & Systems Analyst, primarily dealing in financial and accounting data. I work for one of the Big 4 auditing firms. My interests lie in solving business problems using varied technologies and platforms to drive business decisions and achieve organizational outcomes. Python is one of my favorite software languages. I grew up in Pune, a town in the western part of India, near Bombay. I currently live in Stamford, CT and before that I was in Dallas, TX for many years. I have also lived a short while in Dubai, UAE and a bit in Sydney, Australia. I love Tennis, both as a player and as a fan of the game. Strongly believe Tennis, as a sport, lies somewhere between Chess and Boxing. Stan Wawrinkaâ€™s backhand is my favorite shot.

<h2>
I am a PhD student at the University of Cumberlands in the School of Information Sciences. Specifically, in the Decision Sciences group advised by Dr. Diana Barrett and Dr. Steven Browne. I am interested in the intersection of Business, Statistics and Computer Science, Machine Learning, Topological Data Analysis, Network Analysis, Graphical Methods, and Decision Sciences. I'm currently finalizing my dissertation paper.

Before joining UC, I was at Fairfield University doing my MS in Business Analytics in the department of Statistics and Data Science. I recieved my BS in Electronics & Communication Engg. from the North Eastern Hill University in 2004 and during the last decade and a half I have been gainfully employed, workin with latest technologies in various industries.

I work for one of the Big 4 auditing firms. Python is one of my favorite software languages. I grew up in Pune, a town in the western part of India, near Bombay. I currently live in Stamford, CT and before that I was in Dallas, TX for many years. I have also lived a short while in Dubai, UAE and a bit in Sydney, Australia. I love Tennis, both as a player and as a fan of the game. Strongly believe Tennis, as a sport, lies somewhere between Chess and Boxing. Stan Wawrinkaâ€™s backhand is my favorite shot.

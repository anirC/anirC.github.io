<h2>
I am a PhD student at the University of Southern California in the department of Data Sciences and Operations housed in the Marshall School of Business. Specifically, in the statistics group advised by Dr. Gareth James and Dr. Xin Tong. I am interested in the intersection of Statistics and Computer Science, Machine Learning, Topological Data Analysis, Network Analysis, Graphical Methods, and Mathematical Statistics. My research is currently supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

Before joining USC I was at Yale University supported by the Emerging Scholars Initiative Fellowship housed in the department of Statistics and Data Science. I recieved my B.S. in Applied and Computational Mathematics from the University of Southern California in 2016 and during the 2014-2015 academic year I studied on the general course at the London School of Economics and Political Science, of which I am an alumni of.

I have previously interned for the Cyber Insurance Group at Symantec, Summit Consulting, Swoon Editions, and have been a swim coach for Southern California Aquatics. I have also conducted private consulting projects when time permits.
